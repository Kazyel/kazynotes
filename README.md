# Todo Practice

Every front end developer one day has to make at least one to-do, right? No, but this is my take!

The project is built in **React + Vite** as the main framework, I also use:
- **Tailwind** for styles
- **TypeScript**, JavaScript but *way* better
- **React Query + Axios** because fetch is trash

For the server I built it with:
- **Node.js + Express + Axios**
- **SQLite** as my database
- **Sequelize** for ORM (no, I won't right SQL queries)
