# Todo Practice

Every front end developer one day has to make at least one to-do, right? No, but this is my take!

The front-end is built in **React/Vite with TypeScript** as the main framework, I also use:
- **Tailwind** for styles
- **React Query + Axios** because default fetching is trash
- **React Router** for very basic page routes
- **Zustand** for global state management

The server I built it with:
- Old combo of **Node.js + Express + Axios**
- **SQLite** as my database
- **Sequelize** for ORM (no, I won't right SQL queries)
