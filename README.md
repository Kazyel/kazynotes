Every web developer one day has to make at least one "to-do app", right? No, but I've done it because why not! :fire:

The project is *WAY* far from being complete, it would need way more code refactoring and reviewing.<br>

But, the result is basically what I wanted to get from it, so, I'm very satisfied and ready for next ones!<br>

It really helped me to consolidate a lot of inital concepts about making an API, creating a database and how to consume data from it with creation of contexts!   

## How the project was made:
:zap: **The front-end is built in React/Vite with TypeScript as the main framework, I also use:**
- **Tailwind** for styles
- **React Query + Axios** because default fetching is trash
- **React Router** for very basic page routes
- **Zustand** for global state management


ðŸ’» **The server I built it with**:
- Old combo of **Node.js + Express + Axios**
- **SQLite** as my database
- **Sequelize** for ORM (no, I won't right SQL queries)
